This is my final project for COMP 126: Intro to Web Development.
The project was to redesign an existing website to better reflect its intended audience and uphold best design and accessibility practices.
I chose to redesign a website on Irish shipwrecks.
Included is a design brief, which outlines the changes I made to the original design, as well as wireframes, a color pallette, and font outlines.
